The incident occurred when Ghosh's mobile phone was snatched at the New Alipore island while he was traveling on a nearly empty bus during the night. The streets of New Alipore and the Port area have witnessed multiple occurrences of a gang of pickpockets targeting mobile phones through the windows of waiting buses and local trains. After the swift theft, the culprits have been exploiting UPI apps installed on these phones, often with saved passwords, to siphon off money. Narrating his ordeal, Ghosh shared, 'I was returning from my office at Behala. I was sitting by the window of the bus, busy typing a message on my phone. The accused, who stood outside the window, suddenly snatched the phone and ran away before I could even react. Within 15 minutes, Rs 42,000 was debited from my account'.",
